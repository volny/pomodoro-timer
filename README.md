# Pomodoro Timer

## Menu Screen
- A setup screen has a slider for break length, from 1 to 30 minutes, and a slider for Session Length, from 5 minutes to 120. One button below says "Start session".

## Timer Screen
- the whole window should change color proportional to the time elapsed. If wider than high, go from left to right, else go from bottom to top.
- Just one big timer in middle of screen with flexbox: "5 Minutes 37 Seconds". On small width should collapse to two rows.
- breaktime starts automatically after time is up, and is visually distinguished by a different background color, and a row above the timer saying 'Break Time'. Two buttons below say 'Start the next Session' and 'Back to Menu'.
- After breaktime is up, it says "Break is up", color changes to red, a timer with a '-' in front starts counting up to 10 min. If still no user input return to the Menu Screen.
